                <h2>CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
                <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand access of computing resources—physical servers or virtual servers, data storage, networking capabilities, application development tools, software, AI-powered analytic tools and more—over the internet with pay-per-use pricing. This model offers customers greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Cloud computing plays a pivotal role in our everyday lives, whether accessing a cloud application like Google Gmail, streaming a movie on Netflix or playing a cloud-hosted video game.

            Cloud computing has also become indispensable in business settings—from small startups to global enterprises. Its many business applications include enabling remote work by making data and applications accessible from anywhere, creating the framework for seamless omnichannel customer engagement, and providing the vast computing power and other resources needed to leverage cutting-edge technologies like generative AI and quantum computing. </p>

            <h2> ORGIN OF CLOUD COMPUTING</h2>
            <p>The origins of cloud computing technology go back to the early 1960s, when Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider (link resides outside ibm.com), an American computer scientist and psychologist known as the ‘father of cloud computing’ introduced the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an Intergalactic Computer Network. However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s that modern cloud infrastructure for business emerged</p>
            <P>In 2002, Amazon Web Services launched cloud-based storage and computing services. In 2006, it introduced Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), an offering that allowed users to rent virtual computers to run their applications. That same year, Google introduced Google Apps suite (now called Google Workspace)—a collection of SaaS productivity applications. In 2009, Microsoft launched its first SaaS application, Microsoft Office 2011. Flash forward to today and Gartner predicts worldwide end-user spending on public cloud will total $679 billion and is projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2027 (link resides outside ibm.com).
